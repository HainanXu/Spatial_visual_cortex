# Spatial Visual Cortex Data Analysis

The docs is constitute of 2 parts:

1. image processing: extracting the spatial informations and cell features from given image. Detailed steps include image enhencement, morphological oeration, cell segmentation and feature extraction.

2. spatial statistics:

   · layer segmentation and  statistical analysis for extracted data using scatterplot, histogram, quadrat count, intensity estimation, G function, K function, L function, Paired correlation function, dirichelet tessillation and triangulation.

   ·generation of inhomogenous Poisson point pattern.

   ·3d visualization of intensity estimation graph using plotly.

   

## 1 Image processing
01: Explored and learnt about image manipulation on inital image example.





02: Extracted the information and analysis for the following image.



03: Feature extraction for cropped image with more MBP cells.


04: Feature extraction and density estimation for sample 29,79,179(ordered from left to right) to compare with the integrated data using Pipsqeak.  This step is used for check whether the datasets from Pipsueak is combined in correct order.



## 2 Spatial statistics

00: A demo workflow that includes: cell segmentation, cell feature extraction, intensity estimation, L function, G function, L function, and paired correlation function.

01:Combined datasets obtained from Pipsqueak for sample image 179. Analyzed the integrated dataset by checking CSR using quadrat count, G function, K function and paired correlation function. Explored dirichlet tessellation.

02: Combined datasets obtained from Pipsueak for sample images 29,79,129.

03:Generation of inhomogenous Poisson point pattern.

04: A rough analysis and layer segmentation for sample images 29,79,129,179.

05: Final version of statistical analysis and layer segmentation for sample images 29,79,129,179.
